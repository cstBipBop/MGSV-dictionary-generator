# MGSV-dictionary-generator
lua 5.1.5

Builds QAR and LNG dictionaries with lua. Checks for duplicates and verifies generated entries by checking against hash lists.
Can do either a dictionary or brute-force attack.

Uses Atvaarks' Fox.StrCode32.exe and a slightly modified version of unknown123's mgsv_path_hasher.exe (changed default switches).
